# Pima-Indian-diabetes-prediction-deep-learning-model
Pima Indians Onset of diabetes dataset describes patient medical record data for Pima Indians whether they had an onset of diabetes within five years.
This is a binary classification problem (onset of diabetes as 1 or not as 0). All of the input variables that describe each patient are numerical. 
This makes it easy to use directly with neural networks that expect numerical input and output values, and ideal for our first neural network in Keras.

The objective of the Pima Indian diabetes dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic information included in the dataset.
All the patients are female and of Pima Indian heritage.
